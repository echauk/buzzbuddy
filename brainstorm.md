# Hack Like W@CC '20 Ideas:

## education:
1. anti plagiarism chrome extension that students can run while they are writing, also auto-creates citations
2. source finder for dbqs and such (highlight something in your google doc, click the extension, and the extension searches the web for sources that might support your reasoning
3. mental health-related project? online school is not it for sure
4. report harrassment issues and mental health concerns on campus and be paired with a student to have a coffee chat with? (seems kinda cheesy and might already exist)

## healthcare:
1. use maps api to find the nearest pharmacy that has all the items from your prescription
2. professional calendar feature where doctors can store appointments and share with patients so patients can auto-book appointments instead of calling
3. bringing awarness to regular issues faced by women 

## workforce:
1. app/website for monthly bias training for all employees (new topic every month)
2. anonymous harassment reporting system (this is probably also a thing already lol) - could makes things up 
3. alot more men than women in certain fields - app for women across diff projects to interact and get to know each other - problem might be there's a women resources company; more informal rather than keeping it in the workplace

## sports:
1. painful issues with periods
2. issues with confidence 
3. lack of encouragement
4. inequality with body-shaming
5. women have to work harder to prove themselves
6. access to sports equipment
7. not going to gym bc too many guys
