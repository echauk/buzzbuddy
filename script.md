## written script
[introduce ourselves - hi, my name is, etc]. We're excited to introduce Gymder, the very first app for Tech female students to find other female-identifying students to work out with. Our team quickly identified a problem that we believed affected a large portion of the Georgia Tech population: increasing female engagement in athletics by pairing students together while making them feel supported and safe. To support our hypothesis, we created a survey and received responses from over 80 Tech students. Our findings show that almost all girls that responded believed that having a workout buddy would motivate them, so we are certain that our app will have an impact on making the Tech community healthier and getting more girls involved in working out. (not finished yet haha i'll work on it a lil more tomorrow. also plz feel free to add on stuff according to the flow above!)
