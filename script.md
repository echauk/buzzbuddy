# script for video pitch

## flow
- how we decided on our idea
- identified problem, figured out details to our solution
- determined what features we wanted in app
- used figma and thunkable to create app
- show app demo (voiceover during this)
- what we would add in the future: GT specific login, more inclusive/diverse preferences, etc (please add some ideas here!)
- each team member's strength and how we leveraged that (we can all put one strength and one or two tasks that show this strength)

## written script
[introduce ourselves - hi, my name is, etc]. In order: Yesha, Eshani, Sun and Shreya

Yesha: We're excited to introduce Buzzbuddy, the very first app for Georgia Tech female athletes and students to find other female-identifying students to work out with. 

Sun: Our team quickly identified a problem that we believed affected a large portion of the Georgia Tech population: female Georgia Tech students tend to feel unmotivated to workout in a male-dominated environment by themselves. In a survey conducted with Tech students, we found that there is a significant decline in average workout time since the COVID-19 pandemic. Our solution is to create an app that pairs female GT athletes and students together in order to make them feel more confident, supported, and safe to work out on campus. 

Eshani: In order to better gauge our audience, we created a survey and received responses from over 80 Tech students. When asked about workout buddies in our survey, about 78% of girls said that they don’t have a workout buddy, but 97.4% believed that having a workout buddy would motivate them to work out more. We are confident that our app will have an impact on the Georgia Tech community by building relationships and getting more girls involved in athletic training and working out. 

Yesha: 
(Figma) 
As one of the preliminary steps of the design and development process, we created a prototype of BuzzBuddy on Figma. The app’s home screen features login and sign-up options. 

After logging in, the student can view other people’s profiles and build their own. Sun’s profile, for instance, features her photo, the type of workout or sport she’s interested in, her experience with the workout/sport, how often she intends to practice it, and whether she plans to wear a mask. As she scrolls through her feed, she can start a conversation with other users through the chat feature and make plans to work out.

Throughout the prototyping process, we made a series of decisions to retain privacy and improve functionality. To create an account, the user must have a gatech email address to prevent potentially harmful people from accessing student data. The user is then sent to Tech’s authenticated sign-in system. We also ask users about wearing masks to ensure that students feel safe working out with each other. Let’s watch Shreya navigate the app in real time.

Shreya:
We’ll work on this later once the app is finished 
Thunkable -
Showcase your final product, and any tools/skills you used
Talk about the entire experience of the product of using it from beginning to end

Eshani and I worked on developing the front and back end of the app through a platform called Thunkable. We incorporated Google Firebase platform for user authentication and user interaction

Epilogue:

Everyone:
Talk about how each teammate leveraged their own unique skills towards the project
Sun and Eshani:
Talk about features that you would implement if you were to continue working on the project after submission
For future iterations of our app, we plan on implementing Georgia Tech sign on to make BuzzBuddy more secure and ensure that students are only connected with other Tech students. We also plan on adding a more accurate filter system to the app so that the user’s matches are more similar in terms of chosen location and preferences. 
GT single sign in
Filter system for workout information - based on location, preferences
Finally we want to add an AI matching algorithm - based off keywords in the about me section
