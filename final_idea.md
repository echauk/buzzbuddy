# final idea - sports category

## tinder for workouts 
- enter workout preferences
- match with others who share similar preferences
- geared towards female athletes who need more intensive workouts and some can't workout with their team bc of covid restrictions

## logistics
- use thunkable
- write pseudocode tues
- code and design wed and thurs
- video on fri (create script! do over zoom?)

## potentional questions judges could ask
- couldn't they just workout with one person on their team? answer: not all female athletes train with teams
- why can't they workout with their friends? answer: their friends may not match their pace/intensity, athlete would not have a workout session that matches their needs
