# final idea - sports category

## tinder for workouts 
- enter workout preferences
- match with others who share similar preferences
- geared towards female athletes who need more intensive workouts and some can't workout with their team bc of covid restrictions

## specifications and customization
- type of workout preferred
- pace + intensity (also sprint vs. distance)
- time spent working out (looking for an hour run vs. a 20 minute run or longer vs shorter workouts with videos or in gym)
- year + major
- music
- long term (every other day) or just a few times
- will you be wearing a mask? (are you open, do you prefer?)
- (for runners and walkers) usual trails
- additional info option
*not all the fields are required*
- users then receive "matches" – like tinder! – and can choose to "swipe left or right" based on whether they want to
- authenticate through gt email to avoid creepy stalkers
- (optional) users can directly message each other on the app once matched to protect privacy

## logistics
- use thunkable
- write pseudocode tues
- code and design wed and thurs
- video on fri (create script! do over zoom?)

## potentional questions judges could ask
- couldn't they just workout with one person on their team? answer: not all female athletes train with teams
- why can't they workout with their friends? answer: their friends may not match their pace/intensity, athlete would not have a workout session that matches their needs
- what about covid? is it safe to encourage people to work out together?
- privacy concerns? (seem well addressed through customizations and workarounds like not sharing identity)
